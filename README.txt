Retail management systems can help store owners by providing multiple services
 in one place, streamlining the process of running a store
. Everyday tasks such as managing and buying inventory, checking out customers, 
scheduling employee shifts, and keeping track of finances are easily completed using one solution. 
Some platforms are even compatible with mobile devices, so these tasks can be done anywhere in the store.
 By only buying one platform for your business, rather than several, you can ensure that all the systems 
will share information and work well together. Some platforms will even have marketing and analytics tools
 to help you improve your business. Common components of 
retail management systems are inventory management, workforce management, POS, accounting, CRM, 
and analytics. Some products will have marketing or e-commerce tools to help with online business. 
Some platforms will offer physical hardware such as card readers and cash drawers that interface with the software; however, many will be able to integrate with your existing hardware.
